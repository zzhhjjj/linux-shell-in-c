# linux-shell-in-c
This is an implementation of linux shell in C.  
It contains shell features such as command parsing, process management, and built-in functions like *cd* to switch current
directory, *exit* to terminate the shell, *jobs* to show active jobs in shell, *fg* to handle suspended jobs, and *pipe* to redirect input/output.
